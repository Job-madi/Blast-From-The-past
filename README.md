# Blast-From-The-past

#Inspiration
Well, this hackathon is a blast from the past, and so is our project!!
We wanted to dive deep into the game aesthetics and nostalgia of the 90s era. And that's what we've tried to make in our project "Never gonna give up the 90s"

#What it does
You land up in 90s era, driving a 90s car. Then you got two places to visit. Either the game parlour or the Cinema.
In the Game Parlour page, we've got 4 games for users to play, all coded by us!!
The games are - Tetris, Dance Revolution, Pacman and Snake

In the Cinema Page, we've showed the tech advancements that were made in the 90s, and how they formed the building blocks of what we have now, and we've tried to present it in an innovative way.

#How we made it
For games, tech timeline and landing page, we mostly used javascript for functionality and HTML-CSS for looks and design.
<br>
For the street scene, from where user can select from either Cinema or Game Parlour, we've used Three.js library, creating our own skyboxes

The website will be hosted on linode hopefully!

#Challenges
Accomodating everything together was a really challenging task, but we got through it.
Creating everything within the time span and making them work was also tough, but our team did it anyway.

#Accomplishments we're proud of
We dived deep into nostalgia, and the game culture and aesthetics of the era of 90s, the most beautiful era according to our team. That's our greatest accomplishment.

#What we learned
We learned-<br>
making scenes in three.js<br>
many new things in javascript<br>
hosting on linode<br>
designing and video editing aspects<br>

#Whats next for "Never gonna give up the 90s"
We'll be trying to add more games maybe, and make the site interactive and add multiplayer feature.
